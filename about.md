# About PDF Glow

PDF Glow is a small web app that helps users view, merge, split and compress PDFs. Our goal is to provide fast, privacy-respecting PDF tools and clear instructions so users can accomplish tasks without installing software.

Why this app is useful:
- Short, unique explanations of each tool you offer (viewer, merge, split, compress).
- Example use cases and step-by-step instructions for common tasks.

Note: Avoid hosting copyrighted PDFs. Provide links to public-domain examples or let users upload their own files.
